        <h1>What Did I Do</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Over the summer, I interned as a product management/research intern at Epic Collective, a Malaysian social enteprise with a mission to create an ecosystem where normal individuals can be Extraordinary People Impacting Communities. As someone passionate about social change, I learnt a great deal about maintaining financial sustainability of a social business, and strategies for scaling transformative impact.</p>
      <h6>Product Management</h6>
      <p>I am thankful that the Epic team was more than willing to let me work on their digital volunteer mobilisation platform, <a href="https://www.sedunia.me/">Sedunia</a>. While I can't disclose the details of my project, I performed competitive analysis on various non-profits, heavily researched on the current landscape of social impact assessment, and co-designed prototypes of digital impact tracking and project management functionalities for the platform.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in learning more about this project, feel free to reach out to me.</p>
      <h6>Home-Building Project</h6>
      <p>In the middle of my internship, I had the privilege of participating in one of Epic Collective's home-building projects with and for the marginalised indigenous communities in Malaysia, which is interestingly how the social enterprise started. It was an intense 3-day build, before which the participants 2 weekends to acquire intermediate building skills.</p>
      <p>Together with the indigenous homeowners and villagers, we successfully built two modular, durable and adaptable houses.</p>
