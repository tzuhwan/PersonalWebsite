        <h1>Brief</h1>
        <p>The goal of this project was to observe real users interacting with an interface, interview these individuals about their experiences, construct users’ mental models, create personas based on these users, and illustrate a storyboard for one persona.</p>
        <p>Personas are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the mental models of a larger group of user, which include their main characteristics, ambitions, and frustrations. In the context of UI/UX, a designer can use storyboard to communicate a particular user journey, which is proven to be 22 times more effective than plain writing.
        </p>
        <p>For this project, My partner Laila and I decided to choose the self-checkout machine at the CVS located on Brown University’s campus because we believed that the customer groups who interact with the machines would be fairly diverse in terms of age, gender and profession.</p>

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>The CVS self-checkout machine is designed to streamline customer payment flow and minimise labour costs associated with running the front-end of a retail store. Ironically, this is not the case as many self-checkout machines at retail stores are not designed well and frustrated users often have to call over a human employee to resolve irksome issues like items failing to scan, failed payments etc.</p>
            <h6>Pain Points</h6>
            <p>From our research, we mainly realized that our interviewees:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>Think that the self-checkout user instructions are vague, as they often forgot to place their scanned items on the bagging/weighing platform or to press "Finish & Pay" button.</p></li>
              <li><p>Fear being potentially embarrassed if the self-checkout breaks down and so only use the self-checkouts as a last resort when the cashier queues are too long.</p></li>
              <li><p>Think that if the self-checkout is designed better, they would use it to avoid "having to talk to people".</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Constructing Mental Models</h1>
            <p>After conducting user observation and interviews, we synthesised our data points into two mental models:</p>

          <div class="content-description">
            <h1>Constructing Personas</h1>
            <p>Based on our two user mental models, we constructed the following personas using a four-quadrant empathy map, which focuses on what the user thinks, feels, says and does. The archetypal characters represent part of the spectrum of users we observed:</p>
            <h6>Persona 1: Introverted Izzy</h6>
            <div class="portfolio-img">
              <img src="library/izzy.jpeg" id="izzy" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Introverted Izzy is a junior at Brown University who is currently taking 5 intensive courses and is stressed out over consulting recruitment. She can sometimes come across as a know-it-all, a tad arrogant even, but that’s because she really doesn’t like being told what to do. For her, the self-checkout is all about speed, and not having to interact with a cashier. Introverted Izzy represents the users who have busy schedules and tend to be overconfident about how to use the self-checkout. They just want to get out of CVS ASAP, and avoid human interaction.</p>
            <h6>Persona 2: Confused Chad</h6>
            <div class="portfolio-img">
              <img src="library/chad.jpeg" id="izzy" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Confused Chad is a freshman who’s easing into varsity life with a laidback academic schedule and socialises a lot. He only uses the self-checkout when the cashier line is long because he’s unfamiliar with using it. As a result, he sometimes struggle to scan his items correctly or forgets to bag his items. Confused Chad represents the users by highlighting the unfamiliarity and nervousness that some users experience with self-checkout.</p>

            <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
            <p>This user journey highlights the goal that our persona, Confused Chad, wants to accomplish with the self-check out machine: skipping the long cashier line to checkout quickly. However, his user experience is far from his expectations because he still has a the mental model of having a cashier checkout for him and he is unfamiliar with doing the scanning and payment himself. As a result, he misses the instructions on the screen that tells him where to put his scanned items and to indicate that he is done. In the end, the process is longer than waiting at the cashier line, so he didn’t achieve his goal.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>Through our research and interactions with CVS customers, we realised that the design problem potentially arises from the fact that self-checkout machines are <span>fundamentally not designed for consumers</span>, as Brian Merchant points out in his article on <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-self-checkout-is-and-has-always-been-the-worst-1833106695" id="reflection-link">why self-check is and has always been the worst.</a> Supermarket retail services have traditionally always been human-oriented. Whether we are struggling with a bar code, with finding the right aisle or want some simple recommendations at a supermarket, nothing really beats having a (hopefully)friendly and patient retail worker nearby.</p>
            <p>So is automation really necessary? And at what cost?</p>
            <p>Technological musings aside, we believe that some design improvements might include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>Clearer audio and visual instructions for the on-boarding process.</p></li>
              <li><p>simplifying the layout and components of the interface.</p></li>
            </ol>
